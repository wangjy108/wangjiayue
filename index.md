<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I'm Jia-Yue Wang, Max works for me too. 
I'm currently a researcher at [DPTechnology](https://www.dp.tech/en), immersed in the field of computer/ai-aided drug design (CADD/AIDD), leveraging expertise to pioneer innovative solutions. Previously, I served as a post-doctoral research fellow at [Peking University Shenzhen Hospital](www.pkuszh.com) fortunately to work with Prof. Xiao-chi Ma on mechanism studies of ligand-receptor interaction and designing/modifying mechanism-driven fluorescent detectors. I received my Ph.D. in Physiochemistry at [Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.dicp.ac.cn/), supervised by one of the Distinguished Young Scholars [Prof. Keli Han](https://kelihan.github.io/). Aside from chemistry, physics and bit of computer science, my mixed background also involves biology, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in biology from [Northwest A&F univeristy](https://en.nwsuaf.edu.cn/).  

<strong style="color:#0b5394; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#0b5394; font-weight:600">I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of early-stage drug design using Ligand-based strategies and implementing abstract computational chemistry theories for practical industrial applications. My passion lies in bridging theory and real-world impact, driving advancements in pharmaceutical research.</strong></strong>

My research lies in **computer/ai-aided drug design** -- with a special focus on early stage molecular design in the absence of reliable receptor structures. My research interests include **molecular mechanics**, **molecular dynamics**, **(ab initio) molecular generation**, **Ligand-based-drug-design(LBDD)**, **pseudo-receptor theory**, and **virtual screening**.
